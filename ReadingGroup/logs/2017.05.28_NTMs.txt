20:06 Lyote: Howdy.
20:06 pi-: ok we have at least 4
20:06 pi-: cool
20:07 pi-: Henry_Jia: did you manage to get any code working in the end?
20:07 Lyote: I found this paper much more readable than the previous one. :D
20:07 Henry_Jia: pi-: I'm debugging furiously as we speak, so no :P hopefully will be workign soon
20:07 pi-: haha
20:07 Henry_Jia: I'll commit as I go so you guys can see it
20:07 brand0: present
20:08 pi-: well don't feel the need to get it working right now, I don't think we will be able to discuss and load code at the same time.
20:08 pi-: ok confession, I haven't read the paper this week :|
20:08 pi-: It's been a bumpy ride..
20:08 Henry_Jia: Alright, I'll do my best to get it done and available to everyone as soon as I can
20:08 Henry_Jia: Yea same here pi-
20:08 Lyote: No worries pi-.
20:08 Henry_Jia: Well I've read it
20:09 Henry_Jia: But yea, we can explain it
20:09 pi-: Would anyone care to present & give a brief overview of the subject matter?
20:09 Henry_Jia: Should I do the honous?
20:09 pi-: What problem do NTMs solve?
20:09 Henry_Jia: *honours
20:09 pi-: plz
20:10 Lyote: They used it only for very toy problems in the paper. Simple algorithmic things like sorting a list or copying the input.
20:10 Henry_Jia: OK, according to the paper, NTMs are a sort of neural simulation of a computer in a way, and the paper suggests that they can be used to learn basic algorithms, (copy, sort etc.)
20:10 Henry_Jia: Dammit got sniped
20:10 pi-: lol
20:10 Lyote: To be fair, our messages were complimentary. :P
20:11 Henry_Jia: The paper also suggests that NTMs are far more capable than traditional LSTM in learning basic algorithms
20:11 Lyote: Also, I really don't like their use of the word "neural". DeepMind really likes to think that's a synonym for "differentiable".
20:11 RandIter: wait, are you saying they can effectively serve as a superior replacement for LSTMs
20:11 Henry_Jia: Lyote: Seconded
20:11 Henry_Jia: RandIter: I think so
20:12 _sfiguser has left IRC (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
20:12 pi-: RandIter: as I understand, both NTMs and DNCs seek to improve on LSTM
20:12 RandIter: Lyote: isn't DNC a step-up from NTMs, or is it the same thing
20:12 brand0: was the paper suggesting they outperform LSTM in exclusively the algorithmic tasks?
20:12 Lyote: RandIter: DNC is an iterative improvement on NTM, from what I understand.
20:12 Henry_Jia: RandIter: It's a small step up I believe
20:12 Henry_Jia: brand0: the paper only describes algorithmic tasks
20:12 Henry_Jia: It may well do better at NLP and other stuff
20:12 Henry_Jia: but that needs playing around
20:12 Lyote: I'd be interested to see how they perform in other domains where LSTM is used.
20:13 Lyote: Also worth noting: the paper uses two types of NTM's, one with a feedforward controller and one with a LSTM controller.
20:13 Henry_Jia: ^^
20:13 Henry_Jia: The controller is the smaller network inside it which generates the read and write heads
20:13 Henry_Jia: Which can be a LSTM
20:15 Henry_Jia: If the controller is an LSTM then the internal states of the LSTM can be thought of as the cache of a computer with the main memory of the NTM as the RAM
20:15 Lyote: From what I understand, the core idea behind the NTM is to externally model "memory". Their approach uses memory which is differentiable, which allows you to learn end-to-end.
20:15 Henry_Jia: Yep, and it's what I think makes it powerful. Suddenly, memory is not limited by the size of the hidden layer
20:16 RandIter: What precisely am I missing when I don't have end-to-end learning?
20:16 Agro has joined (~Agro@cpe-72-182-58-96.austin.res.rr.com)
20:16 Henry_Jia: What do you mean RandIter
20:17 RandIter: What does end-to-end mean here, as opposed to more traditional deep neural nets
20:17 Lyote: IIRC, in the paper they make an analogy. The LSTM acts like RAM, whereas the weights of the LSTM act as registers.
20:17 pi-: RandIter: I think end-to-end learning just means that the whole thing is differentiable, so you can apply backprop optimisation.
20:17 Lyote: Make of that what you will.
20:17 RandIter: ok
20:17 Lyote: pi-: That's how I meant it, yes.
20:18 Lyote: I think I used it a bit loosely though: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/224118/what-does-end-to-end-mean-in-deep-learning-methods

20:19 Lyote: Henry_Jia: Oops, I refactored that sentence, but forgot to update the variables. :)
20:20 Henry_Jia: :P
20:20 revolve: KV MemNNs could do with a Keras or Pytorch implementation if anyone's got gratuitous free time :P
20:20 Henry_Jia: revolve: yep, and this is shown in the algorithmic tasks in the NTM paper
20:20 Henry_Jia: revolve: maybe after my high school finals are over...
20:21 RandIter: revolve: is there any implementation of KV net
20:21 deego: revolve: what's babi? still googling
20:21 revolve: Henry_Jia: awesome and good luck
20:21 Henry_Jia: deego: I believe it's a dataset of questions and answers
20:21 deego: thx
20:21 Lyote: Henry_Jia: You could just say "after my exams are over". No need to make me feel inadequate. :(
20:21 Henry_Jia: revolve: so gonna need that luck :P

20:21 Henry_Jia: Lyote: hahaha it's the one thing I'm good at if anything
20:21 Lyote: :D
20:22 Lyote: revolve: Does the approach in that paper differ from that in NTM?
20:22 revolve: deego: bAbI's a synthetic story/question/answer dataset from facebook
20:22 deego: ah, thanks, everyone
20:23 Henry_Jia: Lyote: probably, I don't think the original NTM arch is used all that much due to how complex it is
20:23 revolve: Lyote: I've not looked into NTM too deeply as it's not as interesting to me personally as networks for QA/IR
20:23 Lyote: Is there a standard name for neural nets which use differentiable memory? I've been really interested in DeepMind's Neural Episodic Control paper, which does something similar.
20:23 pi-: It's rather interesting that neuroscience still doesn't seem to have figured out the mechanism of memory.
20:24 pi-: It seems like a sensible direction to go looking for a breakthrough in.
20:24 RandIter: you know the brain is a kludge. everything does everything
20:24 Henry_Jia: The advantage we have over neuroscience is we can take neural networks apart and analyse them, most humans won't let you do that to them
20:24 revolve: the disadvantage is the human brain typicall has a billion hidden units

20:25 silver has left IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
20:25 deego: Anyone have a an idea of just how DNC differs from NTM?
20:25 RandIter: revolve: do you see future software development going the NTM/DNC route?
20:25 brand0: so the controller (CPU) is the LSTM, the RAM is the memory matrix, is the training showing examples of the output and input of a specific algorithm?
20:25 Henry_Jia: I think it uses more complex addressing mechanism deego
20:25 Lyote: revolve: What was the first paper you mentioned, where they got 100% on bAbI?
20:25 deego: Henry_Jia: thanks
20:26 Henry_Jia: Lyote: 100% on bAbI? that doesn't seem possible right?
20:26 revolve: RandIter: differentiable memory, yeah. NTM/DNC is as wasteful as you probably perceive it to be
20:26 Lyote: deego: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=steioHoiEms Alex Graves talking about DNC.
20:26 ML-helper[bot]: [ RNN Symposium 2016: Alex Graves - Differentiable Neural Computer - YouTube ]
20:26 Henry_Jia: revolve: I don't know the NTM addressing mechanism makes sense
20:26 Lyote: He talks a little bit at the beginning about the difference between DNC and NTM.
20:26 revolve: more interesting: program induction through easier modalities (pix2code, program induction from natural language)
20:27 revolve: personal project for ~500 years in future: seq2seq as a compiler backend, english to machine code
20:27 revolve: projection*
20:27 deego: Lyote: excellent! saved
20:28 Lyote: deego: He also gave an earlier talk on NTMs that's linked to on the github page.
20:28 revolve: Henry_Jia: well there's four variants including NTM
20:28 RandIter: you say they're wasteful. Why?
20:28 Henry_Jia: revolve: what's the other 2?
20:28 revolve: RandIter: similar to virtual machines emulating hardware
20:29 brand0: in the video graves talks about the need to use curriculum learning for all but the most simple algorithms
20:29 revolve: using a computer to compute computing
20:29 deego: Henry_Jia: why doesn't the addressing mechanism make sense?
20:29 Henry_Jia: revolve: I wouldn't say NTM's addresing mechanism is wasteful, it seems to match very closely something designed to solve bAbI
20:29 revolve: Henry_Jia: NTM, DNC, KVMemNN, REN
20:29 Henry_Jia: deego: Because you have content based addressing, and shift based
20:29 RandIter: so what are the last two of these
20:29 Henry_Jia: Content based addressing allows you to match the thing in the memory most similar to what you want
20:30 Henry_Jia: i.e. recalling information
20:30 Henry_Jia: -> bAbI
20:30 brand0: you have to have content based because there's no random access, only relative, right?
20:30 Henry_Jia: shift based allows you to then shift taht by an index which allows you to access nearby elements
20:30 Henry_Jia: brand0: Correct, there's no random access
20:31 deego: <Henry_Jia> brand0: Correct, there's no random access  <<=== don't they also allow location-based?
20:31 brand0: otherwise the number of params would expand with the size of the memory
20:31 revolve: NTM/DNC would definitely influence how a strong AI reasons about programming, I'd imagine
20:31 Henry_Jia: deego: they allow a small shift, but not "pure" location
20:31 brand0: relative location yeah
20:31 deego: ah
20:32 Henry_Jia: In the paper, I believe they fixed that shift to 3 possible shifts, and therefore only adjacent elements
20:32 Lyote: They use a softmax for one-hot encoding for shifts of -1, 0, and 1.
20:32 Henry_Jia: Yep, and combine that with a circular conv, and bob's your uncle
20:33 Henry_Jia: you've got a circular shift
20:33 Lyote: They also mention "experimenting" with using a scalar which specifies the shift amount, but they don't present results for that.
20:34 brand0: present/
20:34 Henry_Jia: Oh, I din't think I noticed taht
20:34 Henry_Jia: But how would that work? that's not differentiable?
20:34 RandIter: Are they going to soon make fancy structures like trees and graphs
20:34 gucci_meow has joined (~gucci_meo@CPE-124-186-97-50.lns9.woo.bigpond.net.au)
20:34 RandIter: because any serious program needs more than just linear memory addressing
20:35 revolve: RandIter: TreeLSTMs
20:35 Henry_Jia: As in a neural representation of a tree?
20:35 Lyote: brand0: They didn't give those results.
20:35 brand0: RandIter, at the end of the graves talk he says they're expending it to graphs
20:35 brand0: also q&a graphs, whatever that means
20:35 RandIter: ok what are KVMemNN and REN and how are they different
20:35 Henry_Jia: OK, can someone send me a link to explain data structures?
20:35 Henry_Jia: Cos I never learnt those
20:36 RandIter: a graph has connections between nodes and each connection has a scalar weight
20:36 Henry_Jia: RandIter: I know that but how does that work as a data structure?
20:37 Henry_Jia: Is a tree structure just a nested dictionary basically?
20:37 revolve: RandIter: kvmemnn stuffs an entire document in differentiable memory and then uses similarity and attention to match questions to relevant parts of supporting documents
20:37 revolve: REN appears to be very similar but I couldn't tell you what's different off the top of my head
20:37 Henry_Jia: revolve: that seems similar to NTM
20:38 pi-: Henry_Jia: yep, like files on your hard drive (only without symlinks)
20:38 Lyote: Henry_Jia: Do you know about the difference between a linked list and an array? I think that's the simplest type of data structure.
20:38 mson has left IRC (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
20:38 Henry_Jia: Lyote: nope, I know nothing about data structures, I can code but
20:38 RandIter: tree is acyclic
20:39 Henry_Jia: I know that, I know graph theory
20:39 Henry_Jia: But how would a tree structure work in terms of code?
20:39 Lyote: Typically you see it structured as a class.
20:40 Lyote: I think we're straying a bit from the main topic, maybe it's best to revisit this after the RG?
20:40 Henry_Jia: Sure
20:40 tomzx: Henry_Jia: yes, you could implement it as a list of links + identifier, where your identifier are stored in a dictionary
20:40 Henry_Jia: Let's get back to NTMs
20:40 revolve: RandIter: if you run a kvmemnn and get interesting results let a mammal know

20:48 brand0: In the architecture graph the controller has multiple arrows between the read head but not the write, what is that implying?
20:50 revolve: what do NTMs take as input?
20:50 revolve: how do you describe a program to an NTM?
20:50 Henry_Jia: You don't
20:50 deego: brand0: which figure? in the paper?
20:50 Henry_Jia: You jsut give it the target and the input you would normally
20:50 revolve: can you give an example?
20:50 brand0: deego, figure 1 in the paper

20:51 Lyote: revolve: Figure 6 of the paper.
20:51 brand0: revolve, unsorted list input sorted list target
20:51 deego: brand0: ah, figure 1. The arrow running to the controller for the READ represents the contents of READ being fed back to the controller.
20:51 Henry_Jia: i.e. with their copy example they just feed in the stuff they want copied, and then set the targets to that again at a latter timestep
20:51 revolve: brand0: thanks
20:51 brand0: deego, gotcha thanks
20:52 deego: brand0: READ controller emits a read location (via content/location) which goes to memory, and then reads from memory, and then that data is fed to the controller. Write, otoh, is a one-way operation, of course.
20:52 revolve: Henry_Jia: if you put a pytorch implementation on github I'd probably use it as a basis for a pytorch implementation of Key-Value Memory Networks

20:56 pi-: Did anyone find any other resources that presented NTMs better than the original paper?
20:56 revolve: KV memnn is written down on my list of things to implement so I wouldn't worry about that in any real way
20:56 pi-: I've managed a quick skim, but I definitely wouldn't be able to implement one off that.
20:57 Henry_Jia: pi-: not yet, NTMs are kindo f exotic and most people don't use them because they're complicated
20:57 Henry_Jia: I think
20:57 Henry_Jia: pi-: I dunno, the paper is quitr
20:57 Henry_Jia: quite detailed
20:58 deego: Henry_Jia: aren't they also very computationally "wasteful" atm?  In that the entire memory matrix needs to be operated on?
20:58 RandIter: Is there no "NTM/DNC layer" that can be easily added via Keras, etc.?
20:58 deego: and differentiable info needs to be kept
20:58 Henry_Jia: It's much more efficient than an LSTM
20:58 Henry_Jia: Suppose you use a 128 by 128 matrix with 512 neurons, that has the memory capacity of 128 x 128 + 512 * 2
20:59 Henry_Jia: to get that with an LSTM you'd need a LSTM as wide as 64 * 128 + 512 units
20:59 pi-: What is the basic gist of an NTM?  At an implementation level... Can anyone explain it to me?
20:59 Henry_Jia: RandIter: EderSanta had one, but it's not been updated i nyears and the Keras API keeps changing
21:00 Henry_Jia: pi-: OK, you have a controller network which is the LSTM, which reads and writes the memory matrix through read heads and write heads and write vectors
21:00 RandIter: Henry_Jia: Does Keras have an open feature/issue/request for one?

21:06 Lyote: Yeah I think so.

21:16 Henry_Jia: Lyote: how'd you mean?
21:16 Lyote: At very least, I'd expect to see error bars if they did it over multiple runs.
21:16 Henry_Jia: True but I think it's repeatable from quite a few repos
21:16 Lyote: Henry_Jia: Figures 3, 7, 10, etc.
21:17 Lyote: It's just a pet peeve of mine when I see a result that's not obviously internally replicated.
21:17 pi-: I think what I will do is extend public logging as long as the conversation continues, but snip out everything not related to the subject.
21:17 polydo_s has joined (~polydo_s@2402:f000:ffff:64:ed0b:c8cb:9e4d:9fd1)
21:17 Henry_Jia: pi-: gotcha
21:18 Lyote: pi-: Thanks.
21:18 unixpickle: Lyote: there was a similar paper with memory augmented neural networks that had results which were not always reproducible on consecutive runs. They only mentioned it in their appendix once they figured out a fix for it; really annoying. (this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02516)

21:18 Henry_Jia: Lyote: I think it shows the results well enough
21:18 pi-: Did anyone watch that Siraj vid?

21:19 pi-: It seems to have been generally well-received (+495/-11)
21:19 Henry_Jia: unixpickle: oh as in the neural stack/queue?
21:19 unixpickle: Henry_Jia yeah
21:19 Lyote: Henry_Jia: It's not a matter of how it's displayed so much as I have no idea if that's a consistent trend or just a fluke.
21:19 Henry_Jia: unixpickle: always meant to read that, never got round to it
21:19 unixpickle: their model didn't work every time until they did a hacky initialization
21:20 Henry_Jia: Lyote: don't think it's a fluke, EderSanta's reproduced it as with many other repos
21:20 unixpickle: i implemented it last summer without reading that appendix, was toying with it for a while and figured out my own set of hacks to make it work, then noticed the appendix later
21:20 Lyote: pi-: Worth noting that's for the DNC, which I think is more complicated.
21:20 pi-: oh so it is
21:20 Lyote: Henry_Jia: I'm not saying that it can't be reproduced. :P I'm saying that it should have been reproduced by the original authors.
21:20 Henry_Jia: Gotcha makes sense
21:20 Lyote: unixpickle: Ouch, sounds painful.
21:21 Henry_Jia: unixpickle: As in for the NTM, the DNC or the neural stacks and queues?
21:21 polydo___ has left IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
21:21 unixpickle: Henry_Jia: stacks and queues
21:21 Henry_Jia: gotcha
21:21 unixpickle: out of all the memory augmented neural nets i've implemented, stacks&queues were the least useful and the most unsatisfying
21:22 polydo_s has left IRC (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
21:22 Henry_Jia: oh ok, interesting, have yo uever tried NTMs then?
21:22 RandIter: unixpickle: why "least useful"?
21:22 unixpickle: @RandIter: mostly because they were just too hard to train on real tasks
21:22 RandIter: Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures
21:22 RandIter: ok
21:22 unixpickle: i implemented them because it seemed really nice; like, with a stack, your network could learn any context free grammar
21:23 unixpickle: but in practice, it did not learn well
21:24 RandIter: what did the DNC people learn then if not stacks
21:24 Hans-Martin has left IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
21:24 unixpickle: perhaps the DNC provides a better way of parameterizing memory (better as in easier to train vai backprop)
21:24 Lyote: I think unixpickle is talking about a specific architecture, not the idea of using stacks/queues in general.
21:24 RandIter: unixpickle: so you tried to learn a stack without using DNC?
21:24 Henry_Jia: Probably same as NTMs then
21:24 unixpickle: yeah, i'm referring to the specific stack/queue architecture in the paper i linked
21:25 RandIter: looks pre-DNC
21:25 Lyote: RandIter: You could view the "Copy" task as a sort of queue.
21:25 SiegeLord has left IRC (Quit: It's a joke, it's all a joke.)

21:30 cads has joined (~cads@2600:8801:1382:6700:16b3:1fff:fe02:726)
21:31 unixpickle: RandIter: haven't read it, probably should. I am admittedly not an expert on memory augmented neural nets :)
21:31 unixpickle: Lyote: stacks & queues; NTMs; and more recently I created a memory augmented architecture based on training a smaller "memory network" in real time and using it as a kind of key-value store
21:32 Henry_Jia: unixpickle: do you have code for an NTM?
21:32 unixpickle: nah, that was a buggy piece of Go code that I never open sourced
21:32 unixpickle: my stacks & queues are open, but they are in Go and use my old ML framework (which I have replaced completely at this point)
21:32 Lyote: unixpickle: What problem domain were you attacking?
21:32 Henry_Jia: unixpickle: oh yea you use Go for everything
21:32 Henry_Jia: eugh
21:33 Lyote: s/were/are/
21:33 unixpickle: Lyote: meta-learning
21:33 idnc_sk has left IRC (Quit: leaving)
21:33 unixpickle: memory augmented nets are good for meta-learning since, ideally, you have an RNN that can pick up a lot of new info in real time and apply it
21:34 Henry_Jia: what exactly constitutes to meta learning?
21:34 unixpickle: in this case it was an Omniglot task, where you show an RNN handwritten characters from a bunch of different alphabets, tell them the "label" for those samples, and then have it try to get better and better throughout the sequence at classifying samples
21:34 RandIter: learning learning
21:35 unixpickle: the idea being, in this use case, that the network will learn how to learn new characters quickly
21:36 unixpickle: but yeah in general, meta-learning is "learning to learn"
21:36 Henry_Jia: OK
21:37 RandIter: I want to know if DNC is strictly superior to HAM (Hierarchical Attentive Memory) or not.
21:39 revolve: unixpickle: have you open sourced any differentiable memory implementations in golang?
21:39 RandIter: About HAM:
21:40 RandIter: > it learns to sort n numbers in time O(n log n) and generalizes well to input sequences much longer than the ones seen during the training. We also show that HAM can be trained to act like classic data structures: a stack, a FIFO queue and a priority queue.
21:40 unixpickle: revolve: https://github.com/unixpickle/sgdstore https://github.com/unixpickle/neuralstruct. First one is more recent. Second one is old and uses a framework i don't maintain anymore.

21:43 revolve: the omniglot results are interesting
21:43 RandIter: sorry, what is that?
21:44 unixpickle: omniglot is kind of the transpose of MNIST. A lot of alphabets and characters and a few examples for each

21:58 RandIter: revolve: is there a data structure that would not be differentiable?
21:58 RandIter: Hash table, maybe?
21:59 RandIter: or maybe it can be given the hash function and then it would be differentiable
22:00 unixpickle: RandIter hashtable might be too implementation-specific; there's some differentiable "associative maps"
22:01 pi-: Henry_Jia: ok, thanks for making it happen this week!  It was a good one!
